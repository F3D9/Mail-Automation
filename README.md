# Mail-Automation

A simple project that tries to automate the work of sending emails to many people.

It uses the libraries:

**smtplib** for the handling of logging into the account and sending the emails.

**email** to create the format of the mail, with title, body and addressee.

**sqlite3** for database management and record creation.

**colorama** for the colors of the terminal letters.
